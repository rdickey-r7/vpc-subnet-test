### VPC Availability-Zone Subnet Test

It's not uncommon in older AWS accounts (i.e. with EC2-Classic) to come across a "depreciated zone" where VPC subnets are not permitted.
This Python script tests creating a VPC subnet in each availability-zone for every AWS region.

**Requirements:**

* Tested w/ python version 2.7 / boto version 2.34
* A valid profile in `~/.aws/config` or `${AWS_CONFIG_FILE}` with the appropriate API keys

**Usage:**

```
subnet-test.py [ -v ]
```

**Output:**

```
./subnet-test.py


  Testing VPC subnet creation in all availabe zones..

   * Use "-v" (verbose mode) to print error messages (if any) to the screen
